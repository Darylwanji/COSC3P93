K Nearest Neighbors PseudoCode


 - Calculate “d(x, xi)” i =1, 2, ….., n; where d denotes the Euclidean distance between the points.
 - Arrange the calculated n Euclidean distances in non-decreasing order.
 - Let k be a +ve integer, take the first k distances from this sorted list.
 - Find those k-points corresponding to these k-distances.
 -  Let ki denotes the number of points belonging to the ith class among k points i.e. k ≥ 0
 - If ki >kj ∀ i ≠ j then put x in class i.
